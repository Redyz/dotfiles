Hey those are my configs, hopefully this isn't infringing anything.

Please let me know if you want something taken down.

Here is a list of the things this setups:
* tmux
* vim
* bash
* terminator
* newsbeuter
* mutt

The script can be run idempotently, although you might find that those configs are
pretty much specific to me.
